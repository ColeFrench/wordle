# Wordle
![Funny badge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/60-percent-of-the-time-works-every-time.svg)

This is a Python implementation of the viral word game, [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), by [Josh Wardle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/) (ohh, so that's where the name is from).

Additionally, I've coded a bot that tries to win the game with its own strategy! Can you beat it?

## 🛠️ Beta
I still need to polish some features—especially the user experience, which currently doesn't exist—but the main functionality is complete. Simply clone the repo and run `src/main.py` to watch the bot run on a random word.

## Example
For now, you can run the bot on any word by changing [this line](src/main.py#L31). For example, here is the run on `word = 'smile'`:
> Wordle 666 2/6  
>   
> 🟩🟨⬛⬛🟩  
> 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
